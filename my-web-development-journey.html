                    <h2>My web development learning journey.</h2>
                    <p>After two months of learning in the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path, I've decided to start looking for projects and building my portfolio.</p>

                <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
                <p>I've worked as a teacher for nearly 8 years, so I know motivation and consistency are crucial. I practise coding every day for 2-7 hours and build projects to stay motivated.
                    Sharing my projects with friends, family, as well as other learners is a great way to stay active and motivated. What's more, creating projects that can actually help people can brighten your day!</p>
                <h4>How I got started</h4>
                <p>My skills and knowledge as an educator allowed me to smoothly transition the LX design field, and they have also helped me in my web development journey. I can design my own curriculum, and learning path, and know how to choose the most effective and engaging learning resources. 

                    The current blog is under construction, so you cannot find complete articles here yet, but feel free to connect on Linkedin and ask me about my journey!</p>

                    <h2>Figma</h2>
                    <p>Personal favourite! Figma is useful for web design as well as learning design. I always start creating the design there, and when I am happy with the result, I start developing.</p>
